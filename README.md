# Eye-Cancer

# Eye Cancer AI Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI model capable of detecting eye cancer from medical images. Early detection of eye cancer is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This model leverages deep learning techniques to analyze images and identify potential signs of malignancy.

## Features

*   **Image Classification:** Classifies medical images as either cancerous or non-cancerous.
*   **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for high accuracy.
*   **User-Friendly Interface (Planned):** Future iterations will include a web-based interface for easy image upload and prediction.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle large datasets and can be deployed in various environments.

## Project Details

### Frontend

The frontend of this project will be developed using modern web technologies to provide an intuitive and responsive user experience.

*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (or similar, e.g., Bootstrap, Material-UI)
*   **Features:**
    *   Image upload functionality
    *   Display of prediction results (cancerous/non-cancerous, confidence score)
    *   User authentication and authorization (for future multi-user support)
    *   Dashboard for viewing past predictions and model performance metrics

### Backend
## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** Primary programming language.
*   **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning framework.
*   **OpenCV:** Image processing library.
*   **NumPy:** Numerical computing library.
*   **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for flexible data storage.
*   **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Data visualization.

### Backend

The backend will serve as the brain of the application, handling image processing, model inference, and data management.

*   **Framework:** Flask (or similar, e.g., Django, FastAPI)
*   **Language:** Python
*   **Key Services:**
    *   API endpoints for image upload and prediction requests
    *   Integration with the trained deep learning model
    *   User management and authentication
    *   Logging and monitoring

### Database

A robust NoSQL database solution will be used to store user data, prediction history, and potentially model metadata, offering flexibility and scalability.

* 
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **Data Stored:**
    *   User information
    *   Uploaded image metadata
    *   Prediction results and timestamps
    *   Model versioning information
